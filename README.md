# Real Estate price prediction using Deep Neural Network
Deep Learning for Real Estate Price Prediction


In this project, we will predict real estate prices using artificial neural networks. Dataset includes house sale prices for King County in USA and homes that are sold in the time preiod between May 2014 and May 2015.
I had applied MutualInfoRegression from sklearn library to find out the best features in predicting the prices
